"""
Simple API key authentication.

This is intentionally lightweight — a single shared secret read from the
environment, checked on every protected request via FastAPI's dependency
injection. This is NOT meant to replace proper auth (OAuth/session tokens)
for a multi-tenant production deployment, but it is sufficient to gate a
pilot/demo deployment so the inference endpoint isn't wide open to anyone
who finds the URL.

Set API_KEY in the environment (.env). If API_KEY is unset or empty,
auth is disabled entirely (useful for local dev) and a warning is logged.
